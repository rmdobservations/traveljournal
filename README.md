# traveljournal
Create a template travel journal website. Structure is pre-written. Additions from one's trip can be easily added as 
GPX or KML files.
What makes a good travel journal: Text, Photographs, Map 

I started with Openlayers 2 and decided to rewrite to Openlayers 3. I now have code that "just works" and written so that one needs to fill in only a minimal amount of information
about their trip. These should be:
- location
- Name of gpx file
- number of gpx files (legs of a trip, one for each day)
-

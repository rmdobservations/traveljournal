# traveljournal
Create a template travel journal website. Structure is pre-written. Additions from one's trip can be easily added as 
GPX or KML files.
What makes a good travel journal: Text, Photographs, Map 

Map software is Openlayers 3. Code is written so that one needs to fill in only a minimal amount of information
about their trip. These should be:
- location
- Name of gpx file
- number of gpx files (legs of a trip, one for each day)
- text

Requirements:
- exiftool for extracting geolocation from photographs (https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
- jquery.js (https://jquery.com/)
- Openlayers (https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers)
